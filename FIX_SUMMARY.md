# Build Error Fix Summary

## Issue
The application was failing to build with a syntax error in the TaskManagement.js component:
```
[eslint] 
src/components/TaskManagement.js
Syntax error: Unexpected token (1480:9) (1480:9)
```

## Root Cause
There was a syntax error in the TaskManagement.js file where some code was accidentally placed outside the component definition, causing a duplicate export and syntax issues.

## Fix Applied
1. **Fixed Syntax Error**: Removed the extra code that was accidentally placed outside the component definition
2. **Resolved Duplicate Export**: Ensured there was only one `export default TaskManagement` statement
3. **Verified Build**: Confirmed the application now builds successfully with only warnings (no errors)

## Changes Made
- Fixed TaskManagement.js syntax error
- Removed duplicate export statement
- Preserved all previous functionality

## Verification
- Application builds successfully
- No syntax errors reported
- All previous functionality maintained
- Ready for deployment

## Deployment Status
- Changes committed and pushed to main branch
- Application ready for redeployment
- Vercel should now be able to build successfully
