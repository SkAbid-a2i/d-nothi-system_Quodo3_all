# Database Migration Fix Summary

## Issues Identified

1. **Missing Obligation Column**: The application was throwing a `500 Internal Server Error` with the message `Unknown column 'obligation' in 'field list'` when trying to fetch tasks.

2. **Database Environment Mismatch**: Migrations were run on the development database (SQLite) but not on the production database (TiDB).

## Root Cause

The obligation field was added to the Task model and frontend components, but the corresponding database column was missing in the production TiDB database. This happened because:
- Development uses SQLite database
- Production uses TiDB database
- Migrations were only run on the development database

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Created Migration Scripts
- **[2025102001-add-obligation-to-tasks.js]**: Existing migration file that adds the obligation column
- **[scripts/run-production-migration.js]**: New script to run migrations on production TiDB database
- **[scripts/add-obligation-column.sql]**: Direct SQL script to add the obligation column

### 2. Created Fix Documentation
- **[FIX_OBLIGATION_COLUMN_ISSUE.md]**: Comprehensive guide explaining the issue and providing multiple solutions

### 3. Verified Model and Route Updates
- **[models/Task.js]**: Confirmed obligation field is properly defined
- **[routes/task.routes.js]**: Confirmed obligation field is handled in create/update operations

## How to Apply the Fix

### Option 1: Run Production Migration Script (Recommended)
1. Create a `.env` file with production database credentials:
   ```env
   DB_HOST=your_tidb_host
   DB_PORT=4000
   DB_USER=your_tidb_user
   DB_PASSWORD=your_tidb_password
   DB_NAME=your_database_name
   DB_SSL=true
   ```

2. Run the production migration:
   ```bash
   cd d:\Project\Quodo3
   node scripts/run-production-migration.js
   ```

### Option 2: Run SQL Script Directly
Execute this SQL command on your TiDB database:
```sql
ALTER TABLE tasks ADD COLUMN obligation VARCHAR(255) DEFAULT '';
```

## Verification Steps

After applying the fix, verify that:
1. The `/api/tasks` endpoint returns a 200 status code
2. The task management page loads without errors
3. The obligation field appears in the task creation form
4. The obligation chart appears on the dashboard
5. Tasks can be created and updated with obligation values

## Additional Notes

- Always backup your production database before running migrations
- The migration tracking table (`SequelizeMeta`) will record that the migration has been executed
- The obligation field is optional and defaults to an empty string
- The field supports up to 255 characters as defined in the model
