# Field Visibility and Database Connection Fixes

This document summarizes all the fixes implemented to resolve the 500 errors in the tasks API and field visibility problems identified in the logs.

## Issues Identified from Logs

### 1. Database Connection Problems
- Repeated 500 errors on `/api/tasks` endpoint
- Database connection timeouts
- "Database connection failed" errors
- Slow API responses (2500ms+)

### 2. Field Visibility Issues
- "Field is not visible in UI" warnings
- Missing field detection problems
- UI element visibility monitoring

### 3. API Error Patterns
- Task creation failures with validation errors
- Task retrieval 500 errors
- Dropdown loading timeouts

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Database Configuration Improvements (`config/database.js`)

#### Connection Pooling Enhancements:
- Increased pool size: max=20, min=5
- Extended acquire timeout to 60 seconds
- Added aggressive connection eviction (evict: 1000ms)
- Increased retry attempts to 5 with specific error matching

#### Error Handling:
- Added retry logic for common connection errors
- Implemented connection testing with retry mechanism
- Enhanced logging for connection failures

#### Configuration:
- Set proper TiDB default port (4000)
- Added benchmarking for performance monitoring
- Set READ_COMMITTED isolation level

### 2. Task Routes Enhanced (`routes/task.routes.js`)

#### Error Handling Improvements:
- Added specific error handling for database connection errors (503 status)
- Enhanced validation error responses (400 status)
- Added proper null checking for office fields
- Improved error messages with development/production context

#### Task Operations:
- Fixed date handling with proper `new Date()` conversion
- Added validation for required fields (date, description)
- Enhanced permission checking with null safety
- Improved task update logic to maintain user data

### 3. Health Monitoring System

#### Health Check Routes (`routes/health.routes.js`):
- `/api/health` - Basic service health
- `/api/health/database` - Database connection status
- `/api/health/tasks` - Tasks table accessibility

#### Database Monitoring Service (`services/db-monitor.service.js`):
- Continuous database connection monitoring
- Automatic reconnection attempts
- Status reporting and logging

#### System Monitor Scripts:
- `test-db-connection.js` - Database and task operations testing
- `monitor-field-visibility.js` - Field visibility issue tracking
- `system-monitor.js` - Comprehensive system health monitoring

### 4. Server Improvements (`server.js`)

#### Process Management:
- Added database monitoring startup/shutdown
- Implemented graceful shutdown handlers
- Added unhandled promise rejection and exception handlers

#### Error Resilience:
- Prevent process crashes from database errors
- Enhanced logging for connection issues
- Added monitoring service integration

## Testing Scripts

### Database Connection Test (`scripts/test-db-connection.js`)
```bash
node scripts/test-db-connection.js
```
- Tests database connectivity
- Verifies task creation/retrieval/update/deletion
- Provides detailed error reporting

### Field Visibility Monitor (`scripts/monitor-field-visibility.js`)
```bash
# Continuous monitoring
node scripts/monitor-field-visibility.js monitor

# Single check
node scripts/monitor-field-visibility.js once
```
- Monitors log files for field visibility issues
- Categorizes errors by type
- Generates detailed reports

### System Monitor (`scripts/system-monitor.js`)
```bash
# Continuous monitoring
node scripts/system-monitor.js monitor

# Single health check
node scripts/system-monitor.js check

# Detailed report
node scripts/system-monitor.js report
```
- Comprehensive system health checks
- Parallel testing of all components
- Continuous monitoring with status reporting

## Expected Results

### 1. Reduced 500 Errors
- Database connection errors now return 503 status instead of 500
- Better error handling prevents crashes
- Retry logic improves connection reliability

### 2. Improved Field Visibility
- Enhanced monitoring detects UI issues
- Better logging of visibility problems
- Automated reporting of field issues

### 3. Enhanced System Reliability
- Continuous health monitoring
- Proactive error detection
- Graceful degradation during issues

### 4. Better Performance
- Optimized connection pooling
- Faster error recovery
- Reduced timeout errors

## Monitoring Endpoints

### Public Health Check
```
GET /api/health
```
Response:
```json
{
  "status": "OK",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-08T16:00:00.000Z",
  "service": "Quodo3 API"
}
```

### Database Health Check (SystemAdmin only)
```
GET /api/health/database
```
Response:
```json
{
  "status": "OK",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-08T16:00:00.000Z",
  "database": {
    "connected": true,
    "dialect": "mysql",
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": 4000,
    "database": "quodo3"
  },
  "tables": 12
}
```

### Tasks Health Check (SystemAdmin only)
```
GET /api/health/tasks
```
Response:
```json
{
  "status": "OK",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-08T16:00:00.000Z",
  "taskCount": 42
}
```

## Verification Steps

1. **Database Connection**: Verify TiDB connection is stable with new pooling settings
2. **Task Operations**: Test task creation, retrieval, update, and deletion
3. **Field Visibility**: Confirm field visibility monitoring is working
4. **Error Handling**: Verify proper error responses (503 for DB issues, 400 for validation)
5. **Monitoring**: Test health check endpoints and monitoring scripts

## Rollback Plan

If issues persist:
1. Revert database configuration to previous settings
2. Restore task routes to previous version
3. Disable continuous monitoring services
4. Increase logging verbosity for debugging

These fixes should resolve the database connection issues and field visibility problems identified in the logs, providing a more stable and monitorable system.
