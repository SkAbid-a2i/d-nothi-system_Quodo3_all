## Detailed Fixes

### 1. Admin Console Fixes

**Root Cause**: The component was not properly implemented with all required functionality.

**Solution**:
- Implemented the complete Admin Console component from commit 737cdc2
- Verified that AdminConsole.js properly imports and uses AdminConsole_Commit737cdc2
- Ensured proper routing in App.js for the Admin Console component
- Confirmed that the component includes all three tabs:

  - Permission Templates
  - Dropdown Management
- All CRUD operations are functional with proper validation and error handling

**Files Modified**:

- `client/src/components/AdminConsole_Commit737cdc2.js`

### 2. Side Menu Button Visibility and Collapse Fix

**Issue**: 
- Side menu collapse/expand button was hard to see against the white background
- After collapsing the menu, MuiBox and Avatar were preventing full collapse

**Root Cause**: 
- Insufficient color contrast between button and background
- Improper styling for collapsed state

**Solution**:
- Improved the collapse/expand button visibility with better color contrast
- Added conditional styling for dark/light mode compatibility
- Modified the user profile section to fully collapse when the menu is collapsed
- Ensured the avatar and user info properly hide when the drawer is collapsed
- Added visual feedback for hover states

**Files Modified**:
- `client/src/components/Layout.js`

### 3. Notification System Fixes

**Issue**: Notifications were not working in production.

**Root Cause**: 
- Incomplete notification service implementation
- Missing notification methods for various component types
- Missing notification calls in backend routes

**Solution**:
- Enhanced the frontend notification service to work properly in production environments
- Added missing notification methods for all component types:
  - User management (onUserCreated, onUserUpdated, onUserDeleted)
  - Dropdown management (onDropdownCreated, onDropdownUpdated, onDropdownDeleted)
  - Permission templates (onPermissionTemplateCreated, onPermissionTemplateUpdated, onPermissionTemplateDeleted)
- Updated backend notification service to include all missing notification methods:
  - notifyDropdownCreated, notifyDropdownUpdated, notifyDropdownDeleted
  - notifyPermissionTemplateCreated, notifyPermissionTemplateUpdated, notifyPermissionTemplateDeleted
- Added notification calls to all relevant backend routes:
  - User routes (POST, PUT, DELETE)
  - Dropdown routes (POST, PUT, DELETE)
  - Permission template routes (POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Improved URL construction for the EventSource to work in both development and production environments

**Files Modified**:
- `client/src/services/notificationService.js`
- `services/notification.service.js`
- `routes/user.routes.js`
- `routes/dropdown.routes.js`
- `routes/permission.routes.js`

### 4. Dashboard Layout Improvements

**Issue**: Recent Activity container view layout needed to be associated with the Task Distribution and History view.

**Root Cause**: 
- Lack of integration between different dashboard components
- Missing detailed views for data visualization

**Solution**:
- Enhanced the Recent Activity container to show both tasks and leaves in a unified view
- Added a "View Details" button to the Task Distribution chart section
- Created a detailed view for task distribution that shows:
  - Tabular data with category, task count, and percentages
  - Visualization of the distribution data
- Improved the association between Task Distribution and History views by:
  - Adding consistent styling and interaction patterns
  - Ensuring data flows properly between components
  - Making the Recent Activity section more informative and interactive
- Added proper sorting and filtering for recent activities

**Files Modified**:
- `client/src/components/AgentDashboard.js`
