## Technical Implementation Details

### 1. Database Connectivity Fixes

- **Issue**: TiDB connection errors due to authentication issues
- **Solution**: 
  - Temporarily switched to SQLite for local development by changing NODE_ENV to 'development' in .env
  - Updated database configuration to use SQLite when in development mode
  - Verified database connectivity with test scripts

### 2. User Filter Relocation

- **Issue**: User filter was in TaskLogger page but needed in Agent Dashboard My Tasks page
- **Solution**:
  - Removed user filter from `TaskManagement.js` component
  - Added user filter to `AgentDashboard.js` component for all roles including SystemAdmin
  - Updated filtering logic to work with the relocated filter

### 3. Export Functionality Implementation

- **Solution**:
  - Implemented proper export functionality in `AgentDashboard.js`:
    - Added CSV export with proper formatting
    - Added PDF export with structured text representation
    - Added error handling and user feedback
  - Implemented proper export functionality in `TaskManagement.js`:
    - Added CSV export with task data formatting
    - Added PDF export with structured task reports
    - Added error handling and user feedback
  - Verified export functionality in `ReportManagement.js` (already working)

### 4. System Admin Permissions

- **Issue**: System Admin not having same privileges as Admin and Supervisor
- **Solution**:
  - Verified backend routes allow SystemAdmin access:
    - Task routes: SystemAdmin can view, create, update, and delete all tasks
    - Meeting routes: SystemAdmin can update and delete all meetings
    - User routes: SystemAdmin can create, update, and delete users
  - Verified frontend navigation includes SystemAdmin in allowed roles for relevant pages
  - Confirmed SystemAdmin has access to Admin Console, Reports, and Error Monitoring

- **Solution**:
  - Fixed `handleSubmit` function in `MeetingEngagement.js`:
    - Properly handle user details when creating meetings
    - Ensure meeting data is correctly structured before adding to state
    - Added proper error handling and user feedback
  - Improved meeting status calculation and display

### 6. Error Monitoring Tool Implementation

- **Issue**: No centralized error monitoring for System Admin, Admin, and Supervisor
- **Solution**:
  - Created new `ErrorMonitoring.js` component with:
    - Real-time log display with filtering capabilities
    - Statistics dashboard showing error, warning, and info counts
    - Role-based access control (SystemAdmin, Admin, Supervisor)
    - Export and clear functionality
  - Added navigation link to Error Monitoring in `Layout.js`
  - Integrated with existing API services
