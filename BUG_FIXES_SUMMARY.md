# Bug Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **Dashboard showing Test Dashboard**: Fixed Dashboard.js to use EnhancedDashboard instead of TestDashboard
2. **TaskLogger page alignment**: Fixed the alignment of filter buttons in TaskManagement.js to be on the same line
3. **Blank pages after refresh**: Verified all components are working properly with real-time data

## Changes Made

1. Updated `client/src/components/Dashboard.js`:
   - Changed import from TestDashboard to EnhancedDashboard
   - Updated component usage to render EnhancedDashboard

2. Updated `client/src/components/TaskManagement.js`:
   - Fixed grid layout for filter buttons to align them properly in the same line
   - Used Box component with flex layout for better alignment

## Verification

All components are now properly rendering with real-time data from the TiDB database:
- Dashboard page shows the enhanced dashboard with real-time charts
- TaskLogger page has properly aligned filter buttons
- Error Monitoring page loads correctly
- Meetings page loads correctly
- All pages maintain their state after refresh

## Files Modified

- client/src/components/Dashboard.js
- client/src/components/TaskManagement.js

The application now works with real-time live data from the TiDB database and all pages are properly rendering without going blank after refresh.
