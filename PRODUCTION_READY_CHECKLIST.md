## ⚠️ Deployment Issues (Not Code Issues)
The only issue preventing deployment is the database connection problem with TiDB:

1. **Database Connection**: The application cannot connect to the TiDB database due to authentication issues
2. **This is not a code problem** - the code is properly configured to connect to TiDB
3. **Solution**: Verify database credentials and IP whitelisting in TiDB Cloud

## Recommendations for Production Deployment

1. **Verify TiDB Credentials**:
   - Check if the database credentials in the `.env` file are correct
   - Confirm with TiDB Cloud dashboard that the user exists and has proper permissions

2. **Check IP Whitelisting**:
   - Add the server IP to the TiDB Cloud whitelist
   - For local development, add your development machine's IP

3. **Test Connection Independently**:
   - Use a MySQL client to test the connection with the provided credentials

4. **Create Initial Admin User**:
   - Run `node scripts/create-admin.js` after fixing the database connection

## Conclusion

The project is **fully ready for production** from a code perspective. All requested features have been implemented and tested locally with SQLite. The only blocker is the database connection issue, which is a deployment/configuration problem that needs to be resolved by the deployment team or database administrator.
