# Vercel CORS Configuration Fix for New Domain

## Issue Description
The new URL `https://d-nothi-zenith.vercel.app` was unable to login while the old URL `https://d-nothi-system-quodo3-all.vercel.app` worked fine. This was because the Vercel configuration had a hardcoded CORS header that only allowed the old domain.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. The server-side CORS configuration was correctly updated to include both domains
2. However, the Vercel deployment had a hardcoded CORS header in [vercel.json](file:///d:/Project/Quodo3/vercel.json) that only allowed the old domain
3. This caused browser-level CORS blocking before requests even reached the server

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated Vercel Configuration ([vercel.json](file:///d:/Project/Quodo3/vercel.json))
Added a second CORS header to allow the new domain:
```json
{
  "headers": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "headers": [
        {
          "key": "Access-Control-Allow-Origin",
          "value": "https://d-nothi-system-quodo3-all.vercel.app"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "headers": [
        {
          "key": "Access-Control-Allow-Origin",
          "value": "https://d-nothi-zenith.vercel.app"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Cleaned Up Client Environment Variables ([client/.env.production](file:///d:/Project/Quodo3/client/.env.production))
Removed the `FRONTEND_URL_3` variable which was incorrectly placed in the client environment file. This variable is only needed on the server side.

## Deployment Instructions
To apply these changes, you need to redeploy the application to Vercel:

1. Commit the changes to your repository:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix CORS configuration for new domain"
   git push
   ```

2. Trigger a new deployment on Vercel either by:
   - Pushing to the connected Git repository (Vercel will auto-deploy)
   - Using the Vercel CLI: `vercel --prod`
   - Manually triggering a deployment in the Vercel dashboard

## Verification Steps
After deployment, test the following:

1. Visit https://d-nothi-zenith.vercel.app
2. Try to login with valid credentials
3. Check browser developer tools Network tab for any CORS errors
4. Verify that requests are being sent to https://quodo3-backend.onrender.com/api

## Additional Notes
- The server-side CORS configuration was already correctly set up in a previous fix
- Both frontend domains are now properly configured to communicate with the backend
- Make sure to test thoroughly after deployment to ensure the fix works as expected
