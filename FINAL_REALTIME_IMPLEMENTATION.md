### Frontend Changes

#### 1. Notification Service (`client/src/services/notificationService.js`)
- Client-side SSE connection management
- Event listener system for real-time updates
- Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
- Error handling and recovery

#### 2. Component Updates

- **LeaveManagement**: Real-time notifications for leave activities
- **AuthContext**: Automatic initialization of notification service on login
- **LogMonitoring**: Dashboard for SystemAdmin to view logs and analysis

## Real-Time Functionality

### How It Works

1. **Client Connection**: When a user logs in, they automatically connect to the notification service
2. **Server Tracking**: The server maintains a list of connected clients
3. **Event Generation**: When data changes (tasks created, leaves approved, etc.), events are generated
4. **Notification Broadcasting**: Relevant notifications are sent to connected clients
5. **Client Updates**: Frontend components receive real-time updates and display notifications

### Notification Types

1. **Task Created**: When a new task is created, all users receive a notification
2. **Task Updated**: When a task is updated, all users receive a notification
3. **Leave Requested**: When a leave is requested, admins receive a notification
4. **Leave Approved**: When a leave is approved, the employee receives a notification
5. **Leave Rejected**: When a leave is rejected, the employee receives a notification

## Logging System

### Backend Logging

The backend logging system provides comprehensive tracking of:

1. **API Requests**: All incoming requests with method, URL, and response times
2. **Database Operations**: Connection status and query performance
3. **Authentication Events**: Login attempts, successes, and failures
4. **Error Tracking**: All server errors with stack traces and context
5. **System Events**: Startup, shutdown, and configuration changes

### Frontend Logging

The frontend logging system tracks:

1. **User Actions**: Navigation, form submissions, and interactions
2. **API Calls**: All requests to the backend with performance metrics
3. **Component Errors**: React component errors and exceptions
4. **Authentication Events**: Login/logout activities
5. **Browser Information**: User agent, screen size, and device information

### Log Analysis Dashboard

SystemAdmin users have access to a comprehensive log analysis dashboard that provides:

1. **Real-time Logs**: View of recent system activity
2. **Error Analysis**: Common errors and their frequency
3. **API Performance**: Request/response times and success rates
4. **User Activity**: Tracking of user behavior and feature usage

## Testing and Verification

### Automated Tests

1. **API Functionality**: All endpoints tested for correct responses
2. **Real-time Notifications**: SSE connections and event broadcasting verified
3. **Logging System**: Log generation, storage, and analysis tested
4. **Error Handling**: Exception scenarios and recovery mechanisms validated

### Manual Testing

1. **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Tested on Chrome, Firefox, and Edge
2. **Multi-User Scenarios**: Real-time updates verified with multiple concurrent users
3. **Network Conditions**: Performance tested under various network conditions
4. **Security**: Authentication and authorization verified

## Performance Considerations

### Scalability

1. **Connection Management**: Efficient handling of multiple concurrent connections
2. **Memory Usage**: Optimized data structures to minimize memory footprint
3. **Database Queries**: Indexed queries for fast data retrieval
4. **Caching**: Strategic caching to reduce database load

### Resource Usage

1. **CPU**: Minimal overhead for notification processing
2. **Memory**: Efficient storage of connection information
3. **Network**: Optimized data payloads for notifications
4. **Storage**: Log rotation to prevent excessive disk usage

## Security Measures

### Authentication

1. **JWT Tokens**: Secure authentication with expiration
2. **Role-Based Access**: Fine-grained permission control
3. **Session Management**: Proper login/logout handling

### Data Protection
