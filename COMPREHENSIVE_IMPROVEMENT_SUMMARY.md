## Technical Details

### Architecture Overview

```
Frontend (React) ←→ Server-Sent Events ←→ Backend (Node.js/Express) ←→ Database (TiDB)
     ↑                                            ↑
     │                                            │
     └─────────────── Logging ────────────────────┘
```

### Component Integration

1. **AuthContext**: Automatically initializes notification service on login
2. **Task Routes**: Emit notifications on task creation/update/deletion
3. **Leave Routes**: Emit notifications on leave requests/approvals/rejections
4. **Notification Service**: Manages SSE connections and event broadcasting
5. **Logger Service**: Handles all logging activities with file storage
6. **Log Monitoring**: Dashboard for SystemAdmin users

### Data Flow

1. User performs an action (create task, request leave, etc.)
2. Backend processes the request and updates the database
3. Notification service emits a real-time event
4. Connected clients receive the notification via SSE
5. Frontend components update UI and show notifications
6. All activities are logged for monitoring and debugging
