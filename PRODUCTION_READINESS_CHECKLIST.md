## Production Readiness Criteria
Before pushing to the main branch, all of the following must be met:

1. ✅ All functionality must be working without errors
2. ✅ Database migration must be successfully applied to production
3. ✅ All tests must pass (unit, integration, and end-to-end)
4. ✅ No mock data should remain in the codebase
5. ✅ All components must be complete and integrated
6. ✅ Performance must meet acceptable standards
7. ✅ Security review must be completed
8. ✅ Documentation must be up to date

## Recommendation
Do not push to the main branch until all items in this checklist are completed and verified. The current changes should be kept in a feature branch until the project is fully production ready.
