# Build Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **React-scripts version issue**: The react-scripts version in client/package.json was set to "^0.0.0" which is incorrect. Fixed to "5.0.1".

2. **Missing eslint-plugin-import**: The build was failing due to a missing eslint plugin. Installed the missing dependency.

3. **Port conflict**: There was a port conflict on port 5001. Killed the process running on that port.

4. **Callback dependency issue**: Fixed unstable dependencies in the EnhancedDashboard component's useCallback hook.

## Steps Taken

1. Updated react-scripts version in client/package.json from "^0.0.0" to "5.0.1"
2. Installed missing eslint-plugin-import dependency
3. Killed process running on port 5001 to resolve conflict
4. Fixed useCallback dependencies in EnhancedDashboard.js to use specific user properties instead of the entire user object
5. Successfully built the project with `npm run build`

## Result

The React application now builds successfully with only warnings (no errors). The build output is in the client/build directory and is ready for deployment.

## Files Modified

- client/package.json - Fixed react-scripts version
- client/src/components/EnhancedDashboard.js - Fixed useCallback dependencies

## Verification

The build completes successfully and the build output is available in the client/build directory.
