# Build Fix Summary

## Issue
The React application build was failing with the following errors:
1. "Button is not defined" error in EnhancedDashboard.js
2. Build process hanging indefinitely
3. Unused variable 't' warnings

## Root Cause
The main issue was with the `fetchDashboardData` function in EnhancedDashboard.js having unstable dependencies in its useCallback hook. The function was depending on the entire `user` object, which was causing infinite re-renders and making the build process hang.

## Solution
1. **Fixed useCallback dependencies**: Changed the dependencies from the entire `user` object to specific stable properties:
   - Before: `[user, viewMode, selectedUser, timeRange, startDate, endDate]`
   - After: `[user.id, user.role, user.username, user.office, viewMode, selectedUser, timeRange, startDate, endDate]`

2. **Restored missing imports**: Ensured all required components and icons were properly imported.

3. **Restored state variables**: Ensured all state variables used in the component were properly declared.

## Verification
The build now completes successfully with only warnings about unused variables, which don't prevent the build from working.

## Files Modified
- `client/src/components/EnhancedDashboard.js` - Fixed useCallback dependencies and restored imports/state variables

## Result
The application now builds successfully and can be deployed to production.
