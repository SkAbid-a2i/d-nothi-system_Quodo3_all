# Fix for Missing Fields in Admin Dashboard

## Issue Description

The Admin Dashboard task table was missing several important fields that were present in the Task model and other components:

1. **Office column** - Missing from the task table
2. **User Information column** - Missing from the task table
3. **Files column** - Missing from the task table

## Root Cause

The AdminDashboard component was not fully updated to include all the fields that were added to the Task model and other components of the application.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Updated Task Table Header
Added the missing column headers to the task table:
- Office column
- User Information column
- Files column

### 2. Updated Task Table Body
Added the missing data cells to display the corresponding task information:
- Office data cell
- User Information data cell
- Files data cell with proper file count display

## Files Modified

- [client/src/components/AdminDashboard.js](file:///d:/Project/Quodo3/client/src/components/AdminDashboard.js) - Added all missing fields to the task table

## Verification

After implementing these fixes, the Admin Dashboard task table now properly displays all task fields, providing a consistent user experience across the application and ensuring administrators have access to all relevant task information.

## Additional Notes

The implementation follows the same patterns used in other components of the application, ensuring consistency in both functionality and user interface design. The Files column displays a chip with the number of files or "No Files" when there are no files attached to the task.
