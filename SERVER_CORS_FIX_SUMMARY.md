# Server CORS Configuration Fix Summary

## Issue
When deploying on Render with multiple environment variables (FRONTEND_URL, FRONTEND_URL_2, FRONTEND_URL_3), only FRONTEND_URL was working for CORS, redirects, and other purposes. The other two environment variables (FRONTEND_URL_2 and FRONTEND_URL_3) were being ignored.

## Root Cause
The CORS configurations in server.js were missing FRONTEND_URL_3 in most of the route-specific CORS configurations, even though it was included in some (like the SSE endpoint).

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Main CORS Configuration (server.js)
- Added `process.env.FRONTEND_URL_3 || 'https://d-nothi-zenith.vercel.app'` to the main CORS configuration

### 2. Updated Route-Specific CORS Configurations (server.js)
Updated all route-specific CORS configurations to include FRONTEND_URL_3:
- User routes (`/api/users`)
- Task routes (`/api/tasks`)
- Leave routes (`/api/leaves`)
- Dropdown routes (`/api/dropdowns`)
- Report routes (`/api/reports`)
- Audit routes (`/api/audit`)
- Log routes (`/api/logs`)
- Frontend log routes (`/api/frontend-logs`)
- Permission routes (`/api/permissions`)
- File routes (`/api/files`)
- Meeting routes (`/api/meetings`)
- Collaboration routes (`/api/collaborations`)
- Health routes (`/api/health`)
- Notification routes (`/api/notifications`)

## Verification
- All route files already had FRONTEND_URL_3 configured correctly
- Server.js now has consistent CORS configuration across all routes
- Environment variables FRONTEND_URL, FRONTEND_URL_2, and FRONTEND_URL_3 are all properly utilized

## Result
After these changes, all three frontend URLs should work correctly:
1. FRONTEND_URL - Primary frontend URL
2. FRONTEND_URL_2 - Localhost development URL
3. FRONTEND_URL_3 - New Zenith frontend URL (https://d-nothi-zenith.vercel.app)

This ensures that CORS, redirects, and other cross-origin functionality will work properly for all configured frontend URLs.
