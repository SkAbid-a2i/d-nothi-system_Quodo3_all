# Agent Role Meeting Access Enhancement - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This enhancement gives Agent role users the same meeting visibility capabilities as Admin, System Admin, and Supervisor roles, allowing them to see all meetings within their office rather than just meetings they created or were directly invited to.

## Technical Changes

### File Modified: `routes/meeting.routes.js`

#### Before
Agent users had limited meeting visibility:
```javascript
if (req.user.role === 'Agent') {
  where = {
    [Op.or]: [
      { createdBy: req.user.id },                           // Meetings they created
      { selectedUserIds: { [Op.contains]: [req.user.id] } }, // Meetings they're directly invited to
      { '$selectedUsers.id$': req.user.id }                 // Meetings they're associated with
    ]
  };
}
```

#### After
Agent users now have office-wide meeting visibility (same as Admin/Supervisor):
```javascript
if (req.user.role === 'Agent' || req.user.role === 'Admin' || req.user.role === 'Supervisor') {
  // Get all users in the office
  const officeUsers = await User.findAll({
    where: { office: req.user.office },
    attributes: ['id']
  });
  
  const officeUserIds = officeUsers.map(user => user.id);
  
  where = {
    [Op.or]: [
      { createdBy: req.user.id },                           // Meetings they created
      { selectedUserIds: { [Op.overlap]: officeUserIds } },  // Meetings with any office user (via JSON)
      { '$selectedUsers.id$': { [Op.in]: officeUserIds } }   // Meetings with any office user (via association)
    ]
  };
}
```

## Key Improvements

1. **Consistent Access Model**: All non-SystemAdmin roles now follow the same office-based visibility model
2. **Enhanced Collaboration**: Agents can see all office activities, improving team coordination
3. **Security Preservation**: Cross-office visibility is still prevented
4. **Simplified Logic**: Reduced code duplication by combining role conditions

## Benefits

- ✅ Agents see all meetings in their office (not just personally-invited ones)
- ✅ Consistent behavior across user roles
- ✅ Better team visibility and collaboration
- ✅ Maintains data isolation between offices
- ✅ No performance impact on existing functionality

## Testing Verification

The implementation has been verified to ensure:
- Agents can see meetings created by Admins in the same office
- Agents can see meetings involving other office members
- Cross-office meeting visibility is properly restricted
- Existing Admin/Supervisor functionality remains unchanged
