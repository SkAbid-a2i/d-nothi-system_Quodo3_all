# Meeting and Notification System Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Agent Role Users Cannot See Meeting Data and History
**Problem**: Agent users were not seeing meetings they created or were invited to.

**Root Cause**: The query in the meeting routes was not properly including meetings from all sources:
- Meetings created by the agent
- Meetings where the agent was selected via JSON field
- Meetings where the agent was associated through the MeetingUsers table

**Solution**: Updated the query in [routes/meeting.routes.js](file::d:\Project\Quodo3\routes\meeting.routes.js) to properly include all relevant meetings using Sequelize's Op.or operator with proper associations.

### 2. Meetings Created by Agents Disappear After Page Refresh
**Problem**: Meetings created by agents were not persisting after page refresh.

**Root Cause**: Same as issue #1 - the query was not correctly fetching meetings created by agents.

**Solution**: Fixed the query to include meetings with `createdBy: req.user.id` for agent users.

### 3. Meeting Notifications Not Being Sent to Correct Recipients
**Problem**: Meeting notifications were not being sent to all intended recipients.

**Root Cause**: The notification service was not collecting user IDs from both the JSON field and the association table, and was not properly handling admin roles.

**Solution**: Updated [services/notification.service.js](file::d:\Project\Quodo3\services\notification.service.js) to:
- Collect user IDs from both `selectedUserIds` JSON field and MeetingUsers association table
- Combine all relevant user IDs (selected users + creator + admin roles)
- Remove duplicates to prevent duplicate notifications

### 4. Admin Roles Not Receiving All Notifications Through App Bar Bell
**Problem**: Admin, SystemAdmin, and Supervisor roles were not receiving all meeting notifications.

**Root Cause**: The notification service was not explicitly ensuring these roles receive all meeting notifications.

**Solution**: Enhanced the notification service to:
- Explicitly query for all Admin, SystemAdmin, and Supervisor users
- Include these users in the list of recipients for all meeting notifications
- Ensure these roles receive notifications regardless of meeting selection

## Code Changes

### Backend Changes

1. **routes/meeting.routes.js**
   - Improved query logic for agent users to include meetings from all sources
   - Simplified and clarified the query structure for all user roles
   - Removed unnecessary debugging code

2. **services/notification.service.js**
   - Enhanced `sendToRelevantUsersForMeeting` method to collect user IDs from both sources
   - Added explicit query for Admin, SystemAdmin, and Supervisor users
   - Improved error handling and fallback mechanisms
   - Removed unnecessary debugging code

### Frontend Changes

1. **client/src/components/MeetingEngagement.js**
   - Cleaned up debugging code
   - Improved notification handling
   - Removed redundant notification sending logic from frontend

2. **client/src/components/Layout.js**
   - Enhanced notification grouping and display
   - Improved notification categorization

## Testing Performed

1. Verified that agent users can now see:
   - Meetings they create
   - Meetings they are invited to (both via JSON field and association table)
   - Meetings persist after page refresh

2. Verified that meeting notifications are sent to:
   - All selected users
   - Meeting creator
   - All Admin, SystemAdmin, and Supervisor users

3. Verified that Admin roles receive all meeting notifications through the App Bar notification bell

## Impact

These changes ensure that:
- All user roles can properly see their relevant meetings
- Meetings persist correctly across page refreshes
- Notifications are properly routed to all intended recipients
- Admin roles receive comprehensive notifications as expected
