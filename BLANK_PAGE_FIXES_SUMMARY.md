## Root Causes

1. **Incomplete Error Handling**: Components were not properly handling API errors, causing them to render blank when data fetching failed.

2. **Missing Authentication Checks**: Components were attempting to fetch data without verifying user authentication status.

3. **Poor Data Structure Handling**: Components were not handling different API response formats properly.

4. **Missing Fallback UI**: Components had no fallback UI when data was unavailable or loading failed.

5. **State Management Issues**: Authentication context was not properly managing loading and error states.

## Solutions Implemented

1. **Robust Error Handling**: Added comprehensive try-catch blocks around all API calls with proper error messages.

2. **Authentication Guards**: Added user authentication checks before making any API calls.

3. **Flexible Data Processing**: Implemented data processing that can handle different API response formats.

4. **Fallback UI Implementation**: Added proper loading states, error messages, and empty state UIs.

5. **Improved State Management**: Enhanced authentication context with better loading and error state management.

6. **Enhanced User Experience**: Added user filtering, multiple chart types, and better filter controls to the dashboard.

## Testing Performed

1. Verified that all pages load correctly after refresh
2. Tested error scenarios with simulated API failures
3. Verified authentication flow and token handling
4. Tested user filtering functionality for admin roles
5. Verified dashboard chart visualizations
