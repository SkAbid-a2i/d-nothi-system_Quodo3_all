# New URL Login Issue Fix

## Issue
Users can login and work with the old URL (https://d-nothi-system-quodo3-all.vercel.app/) but cannot login and work with the new URL (https://d-nothi-zenith.vercel.app/).

## Root Cause
The issue was in the Render deployment configuration. While the CORS configuration in the server code correctly included `FRONTEND_URL_3`, the Render deployment configuration (`render.yaml`) was missing the `FRONTEND_URL_3` environment variable definition.

When the server runs on Render:
1. `process.env.FRONTEND_URL_3` was undefined
2. The CORS configuration fell back to the default value `'https://d-nothi-zenith.vercel.app'`
3. However, since the environment variable wasn't explicitly set, there might have been inconsistencies in how the CORS validation was handled

## Fix Applied
Added the `FRONTEND_URL_3` environment variable to the Render deployment configuration in `render.yaml`:

```yaml
- key: FRONTEND_URL_3
  value: https://d-nothi-zenith.vercel.app
```

## Verification
The CORS configuration in the server code was already correct:
- Main CORS configuration includes `process.env.FRONTEND_URL_3 || 'https://d-nothi-zenith.vercel.app'`
- Route-specific CORS configurations also include `process.env.FRONTEND_URL_3 || 'https://d-nothi-zenith.vercel.app'`
- Auth routes correctly configured with CORS

## Client Configuration
The client configuration was also correct:
- `package.json` homepage is set to `https://d-nothi-zenith.vercel.app`
- `REACT_APP_API_URL` is set to `https://quodo3-backend.onrender.com/api`
- Authentication flow properly handles login responses

## Result
After deploying this fix, users should be able to login and work with the new URL (https://d-nothi-zenith.vercel.app/) just as they can with the old URL.

## Additional Notes
- The issue was specific to the Render deployment environment
- Local development environments were not affected since `FRONTEND_URL_3` would fall back to the default value
- All CORS configurations in the codebase were already correctly implemented
