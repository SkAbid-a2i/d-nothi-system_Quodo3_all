# Comprehensive Fix for Obligation Column in Task Tables

## Issue Description

The obligation field was properly implemented in the backend and some frontend components, but was missing from the task history tables in the AgentDashboard and AdminDashboard components.

## Root Cause

The obligation field was added to:
1. The Task model in the database
2. The task routes for create/update operations
3. The main TaskManagement component
4. The EnhancedDashboard component with charts

However, it was missing from the task history tables in:
1. AgentDashboard component (my-tasks page)
2. AdminDashboard component (admin task management page)

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. AgentDashboard Component
**File**: [client/src/components/AgentDashboard.js](file:///d:/Project/Quodo3/client/src/components/AgentDashboard.js)

**Changes**:
- Added Obligation column header in the table head:
  ```jsx
  <TableCell>Obligation</TableCell>
  ```
- Added Obligation cell in the table body:
  ```jsx
  <TableCell>{task.obligation || 'N/A'}</TableCell>
  ```

### 2. AdminDashboard Component
**File**: [client/src/components/AdminDashboard.js](file:///d:/Project/Quodo3/client/src/components/AdminDashboard.js)

**Changes**:
- Added Obligation column header in the table head:
  ```jsx
  <TableCell>Obligation</TableCell>
  ```
- Added Obligation cell in the table body:
  ```jsx
  <TableCell>{task.obligation || 'N/A'}</TableCell>
  ```

## Files Modified

1. [client/src/components/AgentDashboard.js](file:///d:/Project/Quodo3/client/src/components/AgentDashboard.js) - Added Obligation column to task history table
2. [client/src/components/AdminDashboard.js](file:///d:/Project/Quodo3/client/src/components/AdminDashboard.js) - Added Obligation column to team tasks table

## Verification

After implementing these fixes, the task history tables on both the "my-tasks" page and the admin dashboard now display the Obligation column with the correct data from the tasks.

## Additional Notes

This fix ensures consistency across all task-related UI components in the application, making the obligation field visible wherever task data is displayed. The implementation follows the same pattern used in other components where the obligation field was already properly implemented.
