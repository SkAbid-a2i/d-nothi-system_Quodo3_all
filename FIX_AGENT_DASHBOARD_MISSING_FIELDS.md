# Fix for Missing Fields in Agent Dashboard

## Issue Description

The Agent Dashboard on the "my-tasks" page was missing several important fields in both the task history table and the edit task dialog:

1. **Task History Table**:
   - Files column was missing

2. **Edit Task Dialog**:
   - Office dropdown was missing
   - Obligation dropdown was missing
   - User Information field was missing
   - File upload field was missing

## Root Cause

The AgentDashboard component was not fully updated to include all the fields that were added to the Task model and other components of the application.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Added Missing State Variables
Added the following state variables to manage the new fields in the edit dialog:
- `editOffice` - for office selection
- `editObligation` - for obligation selection
- `editUserInformation` - for user information text
- `editFiles` - for file uploads
- `editOffices` - dropdown options for offices
- `editObligations` - dropdown options for obligations

### 2. Updated handleEditTask Function
Modified the `handleEditTask` function to:
- Fetch office and obligation dropdown values
- Initialize all state variables with task data

### 3. Added File Handling Functions
Added functions to handle file uploads in the edit dialog:
- `handleEditFileChange` - to add selected files
- `removeEditFile` - to remove files from the selection

### 4. Updated Task History Table
Added the Files column to the task history table:
- Added "Files" header to table
- Added cell to display file count or "No Files" indicator

### 5. Updated Edit Task Dialog
Added all missing fields to the edit task dialog:
- Office dropdown with proper options
- Obligation dropdown with proper options
- User Information text field
- File upload field with file selection and removal capabilities

### 6. Updated handleUpdateTask Function
Ensured the `handleUpdateTask` function includes all fields in the update request:
- Office
- Obligation
- User Information
- Files

## Files Modified

- [client/src/components/AgentDashboard.js](file:///d:/Project/Quodo3/client/src/components/AgentDashboard.js) - Added all missing fields and functionality

## Verification

After implementing these fixes, the Agent Dashboard now properly displays all task fields in both the task history table and the edit task dialog, providing a consistent user experience across the application.

## Additional Notes

The implementation follows the same patterns used in other components of the application, ensuring consistency in both functionality and user interface design.
