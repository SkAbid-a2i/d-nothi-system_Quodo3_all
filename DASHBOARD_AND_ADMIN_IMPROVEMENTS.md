# Dashboard and Admin Console Improvements

## Dashboard Enhancements

### 1. Larger Chart Containers
- Increased the height of all chart containers for better visibility
- Task Trends chart: 350px on mobile, 400px on tablet, 450px on desktop
- Other charts: 350px on mobile, 400px on tablet, 450px on desktop

### 2. Multiple Chart View Options
Added multiple chart type options for each section with consistent button styling:

#### Task Performance Section
- Radar Chart (default)
- Bar Chart
- Pie Chart

#### Office Classification Section
- Pie Chart (default)
- Donut Chart
- Radial Chart

#### Category Classification Section
- Bar Chart (default)
- Pie Chart
- Donut Chart

#### Service Classification Section

### 3. Terminology Updates
- Replaced "Distribution" with "Classification" in all section titles:
  - "Office Distribution" → "Office Classification"
  - "Category Distribution" → "Category Classification"
  - "Service Distribution" → "Service Classification"

## Admin Console User Management Updates

### 1. Removed Office Dropdown Field
- Removed the office dropdown field from the user creation/edit form
- Updated the User model to remove the office column
- Created and executed a migration script to update the database schema

### 2. Database Schema Changes
- Removed the `office` column from the `users` table
- Updated the Sequelize model to reflect the schema changes
- Migration script handles the table recreation process for SQLite

## Files Modified

1. `client/src/components/EnhancedDashboard.js` - Enhanced dashboard with larger charts and multiple view options
2. `client/src/components/AdminConsole_Commit737cdc2.js` - Removed office dropdown from user management
3. `models/User.js` - Updated User model to remove office field
4. `migrations/remove-office-from-users.js` - Migration script to update database schema

## Migration Execution

The migration script was successfully executed to remove the office column from the users table in the database. The script:
1. Checks if the office column exists
2. Creates a new table without the office column
3. Copies all existing data to the new table
4. Drops the old table
5. Renames the new table to users

## Testing

All changes have been tested and verified to work correctly:
- Dashboard charts display properly with larger containers
- Multiple chart view options work as expected
- Admin console user management functions without the office field
- Database migration completed successfully
