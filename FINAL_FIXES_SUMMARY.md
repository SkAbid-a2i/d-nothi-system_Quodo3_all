## 1. Admin Console Fixes

### Issue
The Admin Console was blank and not displaying properly.

### Solution

## 2. Side Menu Button Visibility and Collapse Fix

### Issue

## 4. Dashboard Layout Improvements

### Issue
Recent Activity container view layout needed to be associated with the Task Distribution and History view.
