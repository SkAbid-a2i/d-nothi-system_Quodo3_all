# Fix for Missing Obligation Column in Agent Dashboard Task History

## Issue Description

The task history table on the "my-tasks" page (AgentDashboard component) was missing the Obligation column, even though the obligation field was properly implemented in the backend and other parts of the application.

## Root Cause

The AgentDashboard component's task history table was not displaying the obligation field, even though:
1. The obligation field was properly added to the Task model
2. The obligation field was properly handled in task routes
3. The obligation field was properly displayed in the main TaskManagement component
4. The obligation field was properly handled in the database

## Fix Implemented

Added the Obligation column to the task history table in the AgentDashboard component:

### 1. Table Header
Added the Obligation column header in the table head section:
```jsx
<TableCell>Obligation</TableCell>
```

### 2. Table Body
Added the Obligation cell in the table body section:
```jsx
<TableCell>{task.obligation || 'N/A'}</TableCell>
```

## Files Modified

- [client/src/components/AgentDashboard.js](file:///d:/Project/Quodo3/client/src/components/AgentDashboard.js) - Added Obligation column to task history table

## Verification

After implementing this fix, the task history table on the "my-tasks" page now displays the Obligation column with the correct data from the tasks.

## Additional Notes

This fix ensures consistency across all task-related UI components in the application, making the obligation field visible wherever task data is displayed.
