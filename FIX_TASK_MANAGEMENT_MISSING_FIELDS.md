# Fix for Missing Fields in Task Management

## Issue Description

The TaskManagement component was missing the Office column in its task table, even though the office field was present in the Task model and other components.

## Root Cause

The TaskManagement component was not fully updated to include all the fields that were added to the Task model and other components of the application.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Updated Task Table Header
Added the missing Office column header to the task table.

### 2. Updated Task Table Body
Added the Office data cell to display the corresponding task office information.

## Files Modified

- [client/src/components/TaskManagement.js](file:///d:/Project/Quodo3/client/src/components/TaskManagement.js) - Added the missing Office column to the task table

## Verification

After implementing these fixes, the TaskManagement component now properly displays all task fields in its table, providing a consistent user experience across the application and ensuring users have access to all relevant task information.

## Additional Notes

The implementation follows the same patterns used in other components of the application, ensuring consistency in both functionality and user interface design. The Office column is placed in a logical position within the table structure.
